- Right Tail Area x-distribution
- Right Tail Area z-distribution
- Backwards Right Tail Area
- Backwards Left Tail Area

### Questions 

1. For a normal distribution with mean 70 and standard deviation 15, what is
the probability that a value is greater than 95?

2. With a mean of 120 and standard deviation of 25, what value marks the bottom
15% of the data?

value marks the top 10% of the data?

For problems 7, 8, and 9 below, consider a product with monthly demand that
follows a normal distribution with mean 55 units and standard deviation 12
units. You can restock the item at the beginning of the month but you cannot
order more till the next month.

7. If you need to have a 95% service level what level should you restock to at
the beginning of the month?   

8. If you need to stock to 70 at the beginning of the month, what would be the
service level?    

9. If you have a service factor of z=1.23, what service level does this
provide?
